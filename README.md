# Verifying-Okuns-Law

This project was made the fulfill the coding sample requirement of my application to be a research assistant at the Cornell Johnson School of Business.

If possible, please use Google Colab or Jupytr Notebook and open the Script.ipynb as a notebook file from GitHub. This is much preferable, as the Script.ipynb contains a lot of documentation (a preface, introduction, conclusion, and reflection) that are not available when using the next method.

Alternatively, you can download the whole repository and run the Script.py file on an interface such as the command prompt. The code and documentation can be viewed through a text editor. However, this method requires that Python is downloaded onto the pc, and the Script.py file contains much, much less documentation than the Script.ipynb file as I have found complex documentation to be much harder to read on a text editor.

Finally, a citation of all data sources used can be found on the "Reference Page" document.
