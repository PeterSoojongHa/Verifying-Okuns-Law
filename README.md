# Verifying-Okuns-Law

This project was made the fulfill the coding sample requirement of my application to be a research assistant at the Cornell Johnson School of Business.

Please navigate to the Script.ipynb file and click the button to open the notebook file through Google Colab. The notebook file should also be able to be opened through Jupytr Notebook or any other program that can open .ipynb files (Jupytr Notebook files). It is much preferable to open and run this file, as the Script.ipynb file contains a lot of documentation (a preface, introduction, conclusion, and reflection) that are not included in the script.py file.

If the above method does not work, the whole repository can be downloaded and the script.py file can be run on the command prompt. The code and documentation can be viewed by opening script.py through a text editor. However, this method requires that Python is downloaded onto the pc, and the script.py file contains much, much less documentation than the Script.ipynb file. Finally, this method requires that 4 modules are downloaded onto the computer via the command prompt. The required modules and the commands to download them can be found in requirements.txt.

Finally, a citation of all data sources used can be found on the "Reference Page" document.
